        <i> <strong>
            <h1>HUMOR</h1>
            </strong>

        <p> After Trevor and his cousins, Bulelwa and Mulungisi were playing and started operating at Bulelwa’s ear and made her ear bleed, their grandmother hit the two cousins and did not hit Trevor because of his color. When Patricia came the grandmother told her what happened and she said that she does not know how to hit white kids because he will turn to blue, green, yellow then red. This shows how much Trevor was feared even by his family members and that made him even not have the freedom like other kids to play, That made him a lonely kid but he started to enjoy his own company when he was alone.<br><br>


            Whenever Patricia would take Trevor to Soweto which actually has a very high population of black people. People would actually use him as a landmark to show directions to other people because of his unique color. Kids in Soweto when they saw Trevor they would yell “the white man” in their mother tongue. Some of them would even run away from him not because of his color alone , but also the mentality that the kids and all the black people had about white people , and how they treated black people  , and they took away their properties. There were also distances between the white and black because the white went to South Africa and separated all the blacks from them.<br><br>

            Trevor’s color was also important other than all negative thinking because every time he went to funerals people would treat him so well and appreciate his presence at the funeral, He was a very important person in the society and was for his own advantage. He also made friends on such occasions and he actually enjoyed it when people treat him nice but he did not what them to think that he was as special as they think.
            <br><br>There was humor when their car broke down on Sunday and they wanted to go to church, then Tavor told her mom that the Lord knows that, that day they were not to go to church which is why he made sure that the car wouldn’t start so that they
            could rest because even the lord rested, and her mom told him that, that was the devil talking to him.<br><br>
            <br> Also when there were boys who wanted to steal from him and they were talking in their mother tongue thinking that Trevor did not know what they were saying but he surprised him a lot and that helped him get out of trouble and also make
            friends<br><br>
            <br> Their  was humor when Trevor was explaining how the principal was hitting him, he didn’t feel anything because his mom a very good disciplinarian and he started wising that his mom was beating him he likes the principal.
             Meaning that Trevor was very disciplined because of his mom.<br><br>It was humors when he talked about his birth . He said , when her mother's delivery was taking place,the doctors cut open her belly,and reached in and pulled out a half white half black child .<br><br>
