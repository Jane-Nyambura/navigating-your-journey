                <h1>BORN A CRIME BOOK REVIEW</h1>
               <p>Abel wanted Patricia to treat him like the ladies in his home-place, they were so submissive to their husbands to the extend of kneeling down when serving them food. But Patricia was a modern woman who could work for her own money and even provide
            even more than the man in the family.she was also Independent and there was no instance of her asking for money from Abel. Abel is thinking of having a wife from the village, which I think  she should live him and move on with her life with
            her children because she could provide for her self and the kids.
            <br><br> The worst part is part is that Patricia was being abused by Able when he got drank. So even one day Patricia went to the police station with Trevor to report the case of abuse, but Abel came in and defended himself in the station.
            Able was just asking for forgiveness and Patricia forgives him thinking that he will not repeat abusing her  again. She does all this because of her kids and the love that she had for Abel.
            <br>
            <br>At first we meet Able while he was smoking weed but when he got to marry Patricia she convinced him to stop smoking weed because of religious reasons, She tried to tell him that the body was a temple of God showing that she was carrying and that
            he wanted him to became a better man. But Abel was clearly not ready for the new changes. He then replaced weed with alcohol and even he became more addicted to it to the extend of a busing Patricia. It is very clear that he does not deserve
            to be with a woman like Patricia.
            <br><br> Patricia even applied for a license so as to be able to operate a business because of Abel. But Able kept running it into the ground misusing his money. At the same time patrician was working more because she had more responsibilities
            and earning a better salary. Abel even afterPatricia opened a business for Able he dropped his responsibilities of even paying for his son’s school fee. He literally contributed nothing to the marriage. I really don’t understand why patrician is still with
            Him.
